Opsit Qandda - Quick and Dirty Dependency Analizer
==================================================

Quandda is a java component that will be able to quickly analize
software projects and their dependencies without running the original
toolchains.

This project is still in early stages of development.  Currently only
analysis of pom and npm projects is implemented.
